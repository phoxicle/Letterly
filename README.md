Cute javascript app to print letter-style messages

This script prints words on the page in a fancy font according to a message you put in the URL. I made it because I have awful handwriting but still wanted to write "real" letters to people, and wanted to play with ways that technology could "solve" that for me. 

For instance, the URL "http://pheide.com/letterly/#Dear+github+user,*How+are+you+today?" will print the message to the page. Upon page load, the message is cleared from the URL so the user doesn't see it. This works well with URL shorteners or QR codes.

Spaces and returns must be formatted in a specific way (+ and * respectively). To make it easier to construct such URLs, use the file gen.html.

My personal favorite use of the script is to use a URL shortener, generate a QR code for the shortened URL code, then copy the QR code by hand with marker onto graph paper. Then I put the paper in an evelope and mail it to my friend :)
